# Social_Network_API_NoSQL

## Description

I made a little blog/social network site using NoSQL. I ran it using "Insomnia" showing how everything works on the back end.

- I wanted to see if I could make something similar to reddit on a small scale.
- I had never used NoSQL prior to this so it was quite the journey and glad I could make a viable product!
- I learned so much about how NoSQL runs and is formed. It was a blast doing this.


## Installation

All that is needed is to run "npm run dev" in the terminal to kick this onto a server. Then using insomnia and my routing I was able to do all that you see.

## Usage

Here are a couple screenshots of me using this application inside insomnia.
